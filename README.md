This branch is pretty much the same as the main branch, but you can have themes. 

To use this, you need to run main.py. You then need to download a theme. You also need to create a txt file called theme.txt, and you need to put the name of the theme in that text file (without .py at the end). All of these need to be in the same directory.

Current themes: standard, hacker.
