This is a basic text editor I made with python and tkinter. 

Features:

The Open, Save, Save As and Helo buttons at the top are self explanatory.

You can press F10 to make the window full screen (without covering the task bar).

You can press F11 to go into full screen mode, and you can press escape to exit full screen mode.

You can press F12 to save as.

You can press ctrl + s to save.

You can press ctrl + o to open.

You can press ctrl + h to replace certain text.

You can press ctrl + f to change the font style in the textbox.*

You can press ctrl + b to change the font colour.

Ctrl + c and ctrl + v work just as normal to copy and paste.



To run main.py, you need to add four .txt files in the same directory. The text files you need should be called font_size.txt, font_style.txt, font_type.txt and font_colour.txt. The text files need values entered in them for main.py to work. In font_size, enter the size of font you want (a single number). In font_style, enter weather you want normal text (leave empty), italics or bold (enter just the word italic or bold). In font_type, enter the font type. You can choose from Courier, Helvetica, or Times. In text_colour, enter the colour of the text (e.g. black or red).

I am working on making the text editor look nicer, and some extra features.

Christopher's Text Editor.exe is the application version of the code. It only works on Windows 10.

*Once you have opened the font style window, you can choose either Courier, Helvetica, or Times for the font. You can then choose the font size, and then choose to have bold, italics or normal (leave blank for normal). You would write it in the entry box like this: "Times 30 bold" without the quotation marks.
