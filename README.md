This is a basic text editor I made with python and tkinter. 

Features:
The Open, Save, Save As and Helo buttons at the top are self explanatory.
You can press F10 to make the window full screen (without covering the task bar).
You can press F11 to go into full screen mode, and you can press escape to exit full screen mode.
You can press F12 to save as.
You can press ctrl + s to save.
You can press ctrl + o to open.
Ctrl + c and ctrl + v work just as normal to copy and paste.
